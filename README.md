## Development skills test instructions

Given these API endpoints:

- GET /messages
- GET /messages/{id}
- DELETE /messages/{id}
- POST /messages

at this url, build an SPA that allows the viewer to:

-view a list of messages, displaying the message text and the date the message was posted
-view all details of a single message
-delete messages
-allow posting a new message

The source code for the app should live in a git repository on github that can be cloned for evaluation.

Please DON'T use jQuery, and DO use React for the UI components.

Approach the project as a professional piece of work - assume your colleagues will be working on it and maintaining it, or it might even be handed over to a client.

Please don't spend any longer than 4 hours on the exercise - it can be evaluated and discussed from wherever you get to, and we know your time is valuable as well.

Thanks!
